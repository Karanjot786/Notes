# TypeScript

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional static typing and other features to JavaScript, making it more robust and scalable for large-scale applications.

## Features of TypeScript

- **Static Typing**: TypeScript introduces static typing, allowing developers to define types for variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps catch errors during development and provides better tooling support.

- **Type Inference**: TypeScript has a powerful type inference system that can automatically infer the types of variables based on their initial values. This reduces the need for explicit type annotations and makes the code more concise.

- **Classes and Interfaces**: TypeScript supports object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, interfaces, inheritance, and access modifiers. This enables developers to write more structured and maintainable code.

- **Modules**: TypeScript provides a module system that allows developers to organize their code into reusable and encapsulated modules. This helps in better code organization and code sharing.

## Getting Started with TypeScript

To start using TypeScript, you need to install it globally using npm:

```bash
 npm install -g typescript
```
